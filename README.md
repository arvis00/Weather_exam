# Weather_search

Final project for vanilla Javascript course. 
- Search weather data for specific cities. Data saves in local storage. 
- Each city card has a background gif which is fetched from giphy.com API. Gifs are fetched according to the weather description for that city (e.g. clear, rain, sunny etc). 
- Clicking on the card will bring up a more detailed weekly forcast.
- Background image of the whole app will change according to the weather of the current location of the user.
- Timer is displayed to show when the data on all the cities saved will update. 
- Data of all the cards also updates after every search, reload, click of any card and deletion of cards.
